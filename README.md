# Climate Risk and Disaster Management Project

## 🌡️ About This Project

Hey there! This project is all about predicting extreme weather events in India using machine learning. I've built a system that can forecast heat waves and cold waves by analyzing historical weather data. The goal is to help communities prepare better for climate-related disasters.

## 📊 What I Did

I took a massive dataset of India's weather data (over 131,000 records!) and used it to:
- Identify patterns in temperature variations
- Build machine learning models to predict extreme weather
- Create a 30-day forecasting system
- Generate risk assessments for disaster management

## 🎯 Key Findings

- **Heat wave threshold**: 47.51°C (when things get really hot!)
- **Cold wave threshold**: 12.84°C (when it gets dangerously cold)
- **Model accuracy**: 100% for both heat and cold wave predictions
- **Historical events**: Found 4,796 heat wave events and 4,794 cold wave events in the data

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- **Python** - The main programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** - For data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - For building machine learning models
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For creating beautiful visualizations
- **Statsmodels** - For time series forecasting
- **Jupyter Notebook** - For interactive development

## 📁 Project Files

- `climate_risk_disaster_management.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with all the analysis
- `run_analysis.py` - Python script version (runs without GUI)
- `india_weather_data.csv` - The weather dataset I used
- `climate_analysis_plots.png` - Generated visualizations
- `README.md` - This file you're reading right now!

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels plotly jupyter
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `climate_risk_disaster_management.ipynb`
5. Run all cells (Cell → Run All)

### Option 2: Using Python Script
1. Install the required packages (same as above)
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python run_analysis.py
   ```

## 📈 What You'll See

When you run the project, you'll get:
- Temperature distribution plots
- Monthly analysis of heat/cold wave events
- Machine learning model performance
- 30-day temperature forecast
- Risk assessment for each day
- Feature importance analysis

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

This project helped me understand:
- How to work with large datasets
- Machine learning model development
- Time series forecasting
- Data visualization techniques
- Climate risk assessment
- Disaster management applications

## 🔮 Future Improvements

If I had more time, I'd love to:
- Add real-time weather data integration
- Create a mobile app for alerts
- Include more weather parameters (rainfall, wind speed)
- Build a web dashboard
- Integrate with government disaster management systems

**Note**: This project uses real weather data from India and demonstrates how data science can be applied to solve real-world problems in disaster management. The models are trained on historical data and provide predictions based on learned patterns.

*Happy coding and stay safe from extreme weather! 🌤️*
